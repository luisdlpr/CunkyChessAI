Possible Engines:
Preferrably in python:
- https://github.com/Aryan9301/ChessGame
  - uses a GUI
  - not much documentation
  - no licensing but use is completely personal for experimentation
- https://github.com/VedantChristian16/Chess-Game
  - no documentation
  - text based

Attempted to find others but they had existing bots, want to implement from scratch

Got Aryan9301/ChessGame running with a bit of fiddling around and imported nicer looking sprites.  The GUI works but operation is very clunky... no rules are implemented and requires some major fixes
- rules
- randomly disappearing pieces bug
