Possible Engines:
Preferrably in python:
- https://github.com/Aryan9301/ChessGame
  - uses a GUI
  - not much documentation
  - no licensing but use is completely personal for experimentation
- https://github.com/VedantChristian16/Chess-Game
  - no documentation
  - text based

Attempted to find others but they had existing bots, want to implement from scratch
